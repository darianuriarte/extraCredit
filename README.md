# In-Memory Key-Value Database with Transaction Support

This repository contains an implementation of an in-memory key-value database with transaction support in Python. The code is available at: https://github.com/darianuriarte/extraCredit.git

## Running the Code

To run the code, follow these steps:

1. Make sure you have Python installed on your system (Python 3.x is recommended).
2. Clone the repository using the following command:

   git clone https://github.com/darianuriarte/extraCredit.git

Alternatively, you can download the source code files directly from the repository.

3. Open a terminal or command prompt and navigate to the directory where the code files are located.
4. Run the following command to execute the code:
   
   python in_memory_db.py

This will run the example usage provided in the code, demonstrating the behavior of the in-memory database with transactions.

## Modifying the Assignment

To make this assignment more suitable as an official assignment, consider providing more detailed instructions on the expected behavior of each method and clarifying edge cases or error handling requirements. Additionally, adding support for multiple concurrent transactions or advanced query operations would challenge students to explore more complex concepts. Including a set of test cases covering various scenarios would ensure the correctness and robustness of the implementation while providing clear evaluation criteria. Finally, providing a template or skeleton code structure would guide students and ensure consistency in the implementation while allowing room for their own design decisions.
